Print the following in whatever you usually print in with PLA.  I used 10% infill and no supports or rafts.

Hub
Motor Carrier
Tone Arm Bearing
Tone Arm Pillar
Tone Arm Rest Clip
Tone Arm Rest


Print the following in something light.  PLA is probably fine, but carbon would be cool.  You can find it in "Print in Carbon or Light Material"

Tone Arm

Print the following with 100% infill.  You can find this part in the "Print with 100% infill"

Tone Arm Weight

If you have a large volume printer (300x300mm or larger) you may be able to print the body and 300mm platter in single pieces.  These pieces can be found in "Parts for Large Build Volume".  PRINT UPSIDE DOWN FOR BEST QUALITY.

300mm Platter
Body

If you have a small volume printer (260x260mm or smaller) you will need to print these the split and smaller versions of these parts.  These can be found in the "Parts for small build volume".  Print the largest platter you can fit on your printer.    
220 / 260mm Platter
Left Hand Body
Right Hand Body

Lastly - if you want to do something cool and put a logo on the machine, I'd do it on the platter.  We could emboss it into the platter, but this may cause weight / balance issues.  A better solution would be to use a multi-material printer to paint or print it with your logo on the platter.  I don't know how to do that... :)
